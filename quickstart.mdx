## 1. Launch healthKERI RACK and Mirth Connect

This tutorial will show you how to launch two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> Gateways and configure them to sign and encrypt all data exchanged
between two Mirth Connect integration engine instances.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What is Mirth Connect">
        Mirth Connect is an open-source integration engine designed for data exchange in the healthcare industry. It enables
        communication between disparate information systems by supporting various healthcare data exchange standards, namely, HL7 and FHIR
        for text based patient health information, and DICOM for medical imaging transfer. Mirth Connect is intended to
        facilitate the routing, transformation, and filtering of clinical data between different healthcare sectors and their
        associated information systems. It is used to integrate data from hospitals, clinics, imaging centers,
        laboratories, and pharmacies, and more. **For the purposes of this tutorial, Mirth Connect serves as a stand-in for any
        given integration engine used in the healthcare sector**.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In the `rack-docker` repository there is a Docker compose file called `mirth-connect-rack-compose-sample.yaml` that can be used to launch two instances of <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> and two instances of Mirth Connect using the following command:

```bash Docker Compose
docker compose -f ./examples/mirth-connect-rack-compose-sample.yaml up
```

In addition to the two instances of <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> and Mirth, this compose file also creates two temporary containers that create one
<Tooltip tip="In the context of Mirth Connect, a channel is a fundamental unit that defines the flow and transformation of data between different systems and application, acting as a bridge for healthcare data exchange. A channel is composed of a source connector (which recieves data) and one or more destination connectores (which send transformed data)">[channel](https://www.meditecs.com/kb/mirth-connect-channels-and-connectors/)</Tooltip> on each Mirth Connect instance that are preconfigured to work with the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> instances once this tutorial is complete.
After running the `docker compose` command above, the channels are created and started. The following output on your terminal window indicates that the all containers are operational and that you are ready to continue the tutorial:

``` bash Dockere Compose

```

<Warning>The gateways launched in this tutorial were installing using the `--insecure` option.  They should **only** be used for local testing and experimentation.</Warning>

#### CESR Files and Out-Of-Band-Introductions
In order for <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways to communicate with each other securely they need to be aware of each other's [key state](/essentials/overview#key-state) (the current set of signing keys to use for signature verification and encryption).
  We accomplish this connection by exchanging each gateway's key event log in [CESR](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/) encoded stream files in an Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI).  These files are exported during the `rack install` command that created the Docker images and must be exported from each docker container now running a <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway.

To copy these <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> files out of docker containers, use the following commands:

```bash Docker
docker cp examples-rack-1-1:/opt/rack/data/Rack1-core.cesr ./rack-1.cesr
docker cp examples-rack-2-1:/opt/rack/data/Rack2-core.cesr ./rack-2.cesr
```

We will be using these <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> files later in the tutorial.

## 2. Create local identifiers with Locksmith
Our local <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> wallet and secure <Tooltip tip="Encrypt Sender then Sign Receiver">ESSR</Tooltip> proxy is called [Locksmith](/software#download-and-install).
You will use **Locksmith** for the rest of this tutorial to establish secure connections to the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways' Administration User Interfaces (AUIs).

The first step is using Locksmith is to create and open a **Vault** that will hold the Identifiers used for the remainder of this tutorial.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Vault">
        After launching **Locksmith** for the first time, you will be presented with the Vaults menu, on top of which you will find the **Initialize new vault** button.
        <img alt="Initialize New Vault" src="/images/initialize-new-vault.png"></img>
        Select this button and create a new vault named "Locksmith":
        <img alt="Create Vault Dialog" src="/images/create-vault-dialog.png"></img>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Open Vault">
        After creating the Vault, you open it by clicking the drawer icon <Icon icon="inbox"></Icon> in the upper right corner of the Locksmith window and selecting the newly created vault:
        <img alt="Open Vault" src="/images/open-vault.png"></img>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Identifier">
        Now, let's create your first Identifier. The <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways were installed into the Docker images with predetermined cryptographic salts for both the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> identifier as well as the identifier that is authorized to access the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>.
        To connect to the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways, you must create a local identifier with the same salt that each gateway was initialized with.

        That salt is `DQ7Hzp4faFdbesNx-_a1v`.

        From the Identifiers screen, select the **Add Identifier** button to create your first identifier:
        <img alt="Identifiers" src="/images/identifiers.png"></img>

        Set the name for the new Identifier as "admin", then click on **Advanced Configuration** and copy and paste the salt listed above into the **Salt** field.  Click on the eye ball icon in the **Salt** field to confirm that you have pasted the correct value.
        <img alt="Create Identifier" src="/images/add-identifier.png"></img>

        After you click **Add**, the new identifier appears in the grid with the name "admin" and the AID of `EK4iFDRWMPH2mJ_VSJZt5VgCTg7wupzKX5nipreSOBuR`.

        <Note>It is important to use the name "admin" for this identifier since the name becomes part of the entropy used to create the first set of key pairs.</Note>

    </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Connect to RACK Gateways through Locksmith
Your connection to the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for each <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway is secured using the same <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="Encrypt Sender then Sign Receiver">ESSR</Tooltip> technology at the heart of our gateways.
To establish a secure connection to each gateway you must load the <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> files copied from the running Docker containers in [Step 1](#1-launch-healthkeri-rack-and-mirth-connect).
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Remote Gateways">
        Select <Icon icon="envelope"></Icon> **Remote Identifiers** from the menu on the left
        <img alt="Remote Identifiers" src="/images/remote-identifiers.png"></img>
        Click on **Add Remote Identifiers**. In the dialog that appears, set the **Alias** to "Rack1", then click the **File** radio button and **Browse** for the "rack-1.cesr" file exported from the Docker container earlier:
        <img alt="Connect to Remote Identifier" src="/images/connect-remote-identifier.png"></img>

        Repeat these steps to connect to the second gateway with an **Alias** of "Rack2 and the "rack-2.cesr" file.

        Once complete, you should have the following 2 Remote Identifiers listed on the screen:
        - Rack1 with an AID of `EPIa-VqM9y2EUUMAJ0MAv5AEdDVvaOcFmIxKn5jzIgKk`
        - Rack2 with an AID of `EJ8Rx6lal6S7mlrhp6OuHkxAizP7N5ufzllu4YIbjjvV`.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Proxies">
        Proxies are the final step required to launch the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> screens for each gateway.  Each proxy will sign and encrypt all communication from your web browser to the gateway and decrypt and verify all data retrieved from the remote gateway.

        <img alt="Proxies" src="/images/proxies.png"></img>
        Select **Proxy** from the menu on the left, then click the **Add Proxy Redirect** button to create a proxy.  Select "admin" from the **Associated Local AID** dropdown to use the identifier created in [Step 2](#2-create-local-identifiers-with-locksmith), then select Rack1 in the **Destination Remote AID** dropdown.
        The **Target URL** and **Target Port** fields should populate automatically.
        <img alt="Create Proxy" src="/images/create-proxy.png"></img>

        Repeat these steps to create a proxy to the second gateway by selecting "Rack2" from the **Destination Remote AID** dropdown.

        Once complete, you should have 2 Proxies listed on the screen with **Destination AIDs** Rack1 and Rack2. Both proxies should have the same **Signing AID**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch Proxies">
        To launch the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for Rack1, select the **Actions** menu for its row in the grid and click on the **Launch** button.  The status will change from **<font color="red" weight="bold">Idle</font>** to **<font color="green" weight="bold">Running</font>**.
        Repeat this step to launch the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for Rack2.
        <img alt="Launch Proxies" src="/images/launch-proxy.png"></img>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access RACK Gateways">
        Launching the proxies will open two browser windows, one for each <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> instance. The browsers will display the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for each gateway.
        <img alt="RACK Gateways" src="/images/gateways.png"></img>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Configure Outbound Route
We will use the gateway named **Rack1** as our Outbound Route.  The first pre-configured instance of Mirth, **Mirth1**, has a channel created to load any files placed in a certain directory and send them to the IP address of **Rack1** at port 3333.
We will now create an Outbound Route on **Rack1** that listens on port 3333 and signs, encrypts, and sends data to **Rack2**.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create RACK Identifier">
        Select **Identifiers** from the menu on the left of the **Rack1** <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>:
        <img alt="RACK Identifiers" src="/images/rack-identifiers.png"></img>
        Click on **Add Identifier**. In the dialog that appears, give the identifier an **Alias** of "Rack1" and set the **Number of Signing Keys**, **Number of Rotation Keys**, **Signing Threshold** and **Rotation Threshold** to `1`:
        <img alt="Create RACK Identifier" src="/images/rack-create-identifier.png"></img>
        Click **Save** to create an Identifier that is local to this <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Outbound Routes">
        Now we will define the Outbound Route to the **Rack2** gateway.  First select **Outbound Routes** from the menu on the left:

        <img alt="Outbound Routes" src="/images/outbound-routes.png"></img>
        Click on the **Add Outbound Route** button to create the route.

        Give the Outbound Route a **Name** of "To Rack2" (to indicate the data's destination).
        Leave the **Peer-to-Peer** radio button selected, then select the "Rack1" Identifier you just created from the
        **Local Identifier to Secure the Connection** dropdown. Leave the **Protocol** set to "HTTP" and set the **Local Port** to 3333.

        <img alt="Create Outbound Route" src="/images/create-outbound-route.png"></img>
        Click **Save** to create the Outbound Route to **Rack2**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Export Introduction">
        The two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways will be
        connected to each other using the same <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip>
        file approach we used to connect Locksmith to each gateway. To establish this connection you will now export
        an introduction to the Identifier you created for this
        <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway from the
        **Outbound Route** grid.
        <Note>We export introductions from the route grids so they also contain gateway connection information that allows them to be discovered by other gateways </Note>
        <img alt="Export Introduction" src="/images/outbound-export-introduction.png"></img>
        Open the **Actions** menu for the Outbound Route you just created and select the **Export Introduction** menu item.
        A new file will be saved on your computer named "Rack1-To Rack2.cesr".  We will use this file in the next step.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Configure Inbound Route
**Rack2** now becomes our inbound <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway.  The second pre-configured instance of Mirth, **Mirth2** has a channel created that is listening on port 5555 for inbound HTTP JSON files that it will write to a local directory.

In this step, we will create an Inbound Route on **Rack2** that listens on port 4444 for signed and encrypted data sent from **Rack1**.  No other data will be accepted into this instance of <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> and therefore the **Mirth2** instance of Mirth Connect.
<Tip>Ensure you are in the **Rack2** <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> browser window.</Tip>
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create RACK Identifier">
        Navigate to the "Identifiers" screen in the **Rack2**
        <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>. Click on **Add Identifier**.
        In the dialog that appears, give the identifier an **Alias** of "Rack2" and set the **Number of Signing Keys**,
        **Number of Rotation Keys**, **Signing Threshold** and **Rotation Threshold** to `1`:
        <img alt="RACK Identifiers" src="/images/rack-create-inbound-identifier.png"></img>

        Click **Save** to create an Identifier that is local to this
        <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect to Remote Gateway">
        Because we exported an introduction from **Rack1**, we are able to create a remote gateway on **Rack2** to use
        during the creation of our **Inbound Route** in the next step.

        Select **Remote Gateways** from the menu on the left:
        <img alt="Remote Gateways" src="/images/remote-gateways.png"></img>

        Click on **Add Remote Gateway**, set the **Alias** to "Rack1" and select the "Rack1-to Rack2.cesr" file exported from [Step 4.](#4-configure-outbound-route) above.
        <img alt="Create Remote Gateway" src="/images/create-remote-gateway.png"></img>

        Click on **Save** to load the key state and connection information from **Rack1** into the **Rack2** gateway.

        <Tip>**Remember**: Everything in <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> is "End-to-End Verifiable".  Each gateway verifies all key events and their signatures before accepting the key state into their own database.</Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Inbound Routes">
        Now we will define the Inbound Route from the **Rack1** gateway. First select **Inbound Routes** from the menu on the left:

        <img alt="Inbound Routes" src="/images/inbound-routes.png"></img>
        Click on the **Add Inbound Route** button to create the route.

        Give the Inbound Route a **Name** of "From Rack1" (to indicate the data's origin).

        In the **Route Type** section, leave the **Peer-to-Peer** radio button selected, select the "Rack1" Identifier
        you just imported from the **Accept from Remote Gateway** dropdown. Select "172.31.0.5" from the **IP address / Host Name**
        dropdown and enter 4444 in the **Accept on Port** field.

        In the **Forward To** section, leave the **Protocol** set to "HTTP", then set the destination **IP Address / Host Name**
        to "172.31.0.3" and **Port** to 5555.  That IP Address is the static IP address assigned to the **Mirth2** instance in the Docker compose file
        (The channel created in **Mirth2** is set to listen for incoming HTTP connections on port 5555).

        <img alt="Create Inbound Route" src="/images/create-inbound-route.png"></img>
        Click **Save** to create the Inbound Route from **Rack1**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Export Introduction">
        As we did with the Outbound Route on **Rack1** we must export the introduction to **Rack2**, but this time from the Inbound Route grid:
        <img alt="Export Introduction" src="/images/inbound-export-introduction.png"></img>
        Open the **Actions** menu for the Inbound Route you just created and select the **Export Introduction** menu item.  A new file will be saved on your computer named "Rack2-From Rack1.cesr".  We will use this file in the [next step](#6-launch-routing).
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Launch Routing
We will now complete the connection between the two gateways by loading the <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> file from **Rack2** into **Rack1** and updating the Outbound Route we created in [Step 4](#4-configure-outbound-route).

<Tip>Ensure you are in the **Rack1** <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> browser window.</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Complete Gateway Connections">
        Navigate back to the **Remote Gateways** section of the **Rack1** <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>.
        Click on **Add Remote Gateway**, then set an **Alias** of "Rack2" and select the "Rack2-From Rack1.cesr" file created in the last step:
        <img alt="RACK Identifiers" src="/images/rack2-create-remote.png"></img>

        Click on **Save** to load the key state and connection information from **Rack2** into the **Rack1** gateway.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Edit Outbound Route">
        Because we created the Outbound Route first, we were not able to select the destination Remote Gateway.
        Navigate to the **Outbound Routes** section of the **Rack1** <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>. Select **Edit** from the **Actions** menu of the
        Outbound Route we created earlier and update **Send to Remote Gateway** to point to "Rack2"
        <img alt="Edit Outbound Route" src="/images/edit-outbound-route.png"></img>

        Click **Save** to complete the route configuration for both gateways.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch Routes">
        Launch this route by selecting **Launch** from the **Actions** menu of the Outbound Route named "To Rack2":

        <img alt="Create Remote Gateway" src="/images/launch-outbound.png"></img>

        Perform the same operation on the inbound route in the **Inbound Routes** section of the **Rack2**
        <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>.

        <img alt="Create Remote Gateway" src="/images/launch-inbound.png"></img>

        Both gateways are now launched as indicated by their status changing from **<font color="red" weight="bold">Idle</font>** to **<font color="green" weight="bold">Running</font>**.

        <Note>After one minute, the **Last Ping** value in each route will be updated with a timestamp indicating the gateways are now connected and able to exchange secure data.</Note>

    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>You have now completed the configuration of two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways and can exchange secure data! See the following network diagram for details.</Check>

    alt="Hero Light"

## 7. Send Test Data

As mentioned previously, the Docker compose file launched in [Step 1](#1-launch-healthkeri-rack-and-mirth-connect) created 2 instances of Mirth Connect
and configured them with Channels that would send data through our newly configured <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways.

**Mirth1** has a channel that is looking for any JSON files placed in its local `/opt/connect/data` directory (mapped to the `<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/volumes/mirth1` directory by Docker compose).
When files show up in `/opt/connect/data`, **Mirth1** will send those files via HTTP to the IP address and Port that **Rack1** is now listening on.

To facilitate testing, we have provided 2 directories (`<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/fhir-dataset` and `<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/fhir-dataset-large`) of sample FHIR data files that can be used to test the new secure connection.  We also included a Shell script that will copy the files into the correct local directory to be picked up by **Mirth1**.

To send test files through the secure connection, use the following command from the `<rack-docker dir>/examples` directory:

```bash Load Test
./load-test.sh fhir-dataset 50
```

This command will copy 50 random files from the `<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/fhir-dataset` directory to the `<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/volumes/mirth1` directory which will cause **Mirth1** to pick up those files and send them to **Rack1**

**Rack1** will, in turn, sign and encrypt every file (the entire HTTP transaction, as a matter of fact) and send the, now secured, data to **Rack2**, which will decrypt the data and recreate the HTTP transaction to send to **Mirth2**.

Logging was left at the **INFO** level so you will see a series of log statements from **Rack1** and **Rack2** indicating the successful flow of data, similar to the following:

```bash Rack

<Icon icon="hand-horns" syle="emoji"></Icon> You have sent fully secure data in **Zero-Trust** between two Mirth Connect integrations instances without SSL!
## 8. Verify Results

The **Mirth2** instance is configured to write the files it receives from **Rack1** to its `/opt/connect/data` directory (mapped to `<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/volumes/mirth2` by Docker compose).  To verify that the data flowed successfully through all 4 containers, you can check for new files that will now be in `<rack-docker dir>/examples/data/volumes/mirth2`:

You can also diff those files to see that the full FHIR records have been transferred completely.

If you would like to verify that only signed and encrypted data was sent between the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways, we recommend adding a [Wireshark](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireshark) container to the `mirth-connect-rack-compose-sample.yaml` Docker compose file to analyze the network traffic between the `172.31.0.4` and `172.31.0.5` IP addresses.


## 9. Next Steps
Now that you've connected two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways directly via a Peer-To-Peer connection, you should see one main limitation with this configuration.

At least one gateway will have to listen for incoming connections on a TCP port.  While this may be fine for local testing it can be challenging to test gateways on the Open Internet.

In our next tutorial, we will be demonstrating how to connect two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways using [healthKERI](https://healthKERI.com) Cloud Routers to remove this limitation.

Stay tuned for our next walkthrough.  For questions or inquiries, contact [info@healthkeri.com](mailto:info@healthkeri.com).
