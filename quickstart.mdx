## 1. Launch healthKERI RACK and Mirth Connect

This tutorial will show you how to launch two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> Gateways and configure them to sign and encrypt all data exchanged
between two Mirth Connect integration engine instances.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What is Mirth Connect">
        Mirth Connect is an open-source integration engine designed for data exchange in the healthcare industry. It enables
        communication between disparate information systems by supporting various healthcare data exchange standards, namely, HL7 and FHIR
        for text based patient health information, and DICOM for medical imaging transfer. Mirth Connect is intended to
        facilitate the routing, transformation, and filtering of clinical data between different healthcare sectors and their
        associated information systems. It is used to integrate data from hospitals, clinics, imaging centers,
        laboratories, and pharmacies, and more. For the purposes of this tutorial, Mirth Connect serves as a stand-in for any
        given integration engine used in the HealthCare sector.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In the `rack-docker` repository there is a Docker compose file called `mirth-connect-rack-compose-sample.yaml` that can be used to launch two instances of <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> and two instances of Mirth Connect using the following command:

```bash Docker Compose
docker compose -f ./examples/mirth-connect-rack-compose-sample.yaml up
```

In addition to the two instances of <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> and Mirth, this compose file also creates two temporary containers that create one [channel](https://docs.nextgen.com/bundle/Mirth_User_Guide_4_5_0/page/connect/connect/topics/c_Channel_Components_connect_ug.html) on each Mirth Connect instance that are preconfigured to work with the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> instances after this tutorial is complete.
The channels are created and started.  You should see the following output on your terminal window which indicates that the all containers are operational and ready for the rest of the tutorial:

``` bash Dockere Compose
mirth-cli-2-1      | Importing channel: /opt/connect/channels/mirth2-to-file-from-rack2-http.xml
mirth-cli-1-1      | Importing channel: /opt/connect/channels/mirth1-file-to-rack1-http.xml

<Warning>The gateways launched in this tutorial were installing using the `--insecure` option.  They should **only** be used for local testing and experimentation.</Warning>

#### CESR Files and Out-Of-Band-Introductions
In order for <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways to communicate with each other securely they need to be aware of each other's [key state](/essentials/overview) (the current set of signing keys to use for signature verification and encryption).
  We accomplish this connection by exchanging each gateway's key event log in [CESR](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/) encoded stream files in an Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI).  These files are exported during the `rack install` command that created the Docker images and must be exported from each docker container now running a <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway.

To copy these <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> files out of docker containers, use the following commands:

```bash Docker
docker cp examples-rack-1-1:/opt/rack/data/Rack1-core.cesr ./rack-1.cesr
docker cp examples-rack-2-1:/opt/rack/data/Rack2-core.cesr ./rack-2.cesr
```

We will be using these <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> files later in the tutorial.

## 2. Create local identifiers with Locksmith
Our local <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> wallet and secure <Tooltip tip="Encrypt Sender then Sign Receiver">ESSR</Tooltip> proxy is called [Locksmith](http://localhost:3000/software#download-and-install).
You will use `Locksmith` for the rest of this tutorial to establish secure connections to the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways Administration User Interface (AUI).

The first step is using Locksmith is to create and open a `Vault` that will hold the Identifiers used for the remainder of this tutorial.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Vault">
        After launching Locksmith for the first time you will be presented with a button labeled "Initialize new Vault".
        <img alt="Initialize New Vault" src="/images/initialize-new-vault.png"></img>
        Select this button and create a new vault named `Locksmith`:
        <img alt="Create Vault Dialog" src="/images/create-vault-dialog.png"></img>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Open Vault">
        After creating the Vault you open it using the drawer icon <Icon icon="inbox"></Icon> in the upper right corner of the Locksmith window and selecting the Locksmith drawer:
        <img alt="Open Vault" src="/images/open-vault.png"></img>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Identifier">
        Now, let's create your first Identifier. The <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways were installing into the Docker images with predetermined cryptographic salts for both the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> identifier as well as the identifier that is authorized to access the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip>.
        To connect to the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways, you must create a local identifier with the same salt that each gateway was initialized with.

        That salt is `DQ7Hzp4faFdbesNx-_a1v`.

        From the Identifiers screen, select the "Add Identifier" button to create your first identifier:
        <img alt="Identifiers" src="/images/identifiers.png"></img>

        Set the name for the new Identifier as "admin", click on "Advanced Configuration" and copy and paste the salt listed above into the Salt field.  Click on the eye ball next to the Salt field to see that you pasted the correct value.
        <img alt="Create Identifier" src="/images/add-identifier.png"></img>

        After you click "Add", the new identifier appear in the grid with the name "admin" and the AID of `EK4iFDRWMPH2mJ_VSJZt5VgCTg7wupzKX5nipreSOBuR`.

        <Note>It is important to use the name "admin" for this identifier since the name becomes part of the entropy used to create the first set of key pairs.</Note>

    </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Connect to RACK Gateways through Locksmith
Your connection to the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for each <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway is secured using the same <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="Encrypt Sender then Sign Receiver">ESSR</Tooltip> technology at the heart of our gateways.
To establish a secure connection to each gateway you have to load the <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> files copied from the running Docker containers in [Step 1.](#1-launch-healthkeri-rack-and-mirth-connect).
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Remote Gateways">
        Select the <Icon icon="envelope"></Icon> "Remote Identifiers" icon from the left menu
        <img alt="Remote Identifiers" src="/images/remote-identifiers.png"></img>
        Click on "Add Remote Identifiers" and in the dialog, click the **File** radio button, add an **Alias** of "Rack1" and **Browse** for the "rack-1.cesr" file exported from the Docker container earlier:
        <img alt="Connect to Remote Identifier" src="/images/connect-remote-identifier.png"></img>

        Repeat these steps to connect to the second gateway with an **Alias** of "Rack2 and the "rack-2.cesr" **File**.

        When complete you should have 2 Remote Identifiers listed on the screen, Rack 1 with an AID of `EPIa-VqM9y2EUUMAJ0MAv5AEdDVvaOcFmIxKn5jzIgKk` and Rack2 with an AID of `EJ8Rx6lal6S7mlrhp6OuHkxAizP7N5ufzllu4YIbjjvV`.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Proxies">
        Proxies are the final step required to launch the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> screens for each gateway.  Each proxy will sign and encrypt all communication from your web browser to the gateway and decrypt and verify all data retrieved from the remote gateway.

        <img alt="Proxies" src="/images/proxies.png"></img>
        Click on the **Add Proxy Redirect** button to create a proxy.  Select "admin" from the **Associated Local AID** dropdown to use the identifier created in [Step 2.](#2-create-local-identifiers-with-locksmith), and select Rack1 in the **Destination Remote AID** dropdown.
        The **Target URL** and **Target Port** should populate automatically.
        <img alt="Create Proxy" src="/images/create-proxy.png"></img>

        Repeat these steps to create a proxy to the second gateway by selecting "Rack2" in the **Destination Remote AID** dropdown.

        When complete you should not have 2 Proxies listed on the screen, one for Rack1 and one for Rack2, each using the same **Signing AID**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch Proxies">
        To launch the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for Rack1, select the **Actions** menu for that row in the grid and click on the **Launch** menu.  The status will change from **<font color="red" weight="bold">Idle</font>** to **<font color="green" weight="bold">Running</font>**.
        <img alt="Launch Proxies" src="/images/launch-proxy.png"></img>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access RACK Gateways">
        You should now have two open browser windows, one for Rack1 and one for Rack2 showing the <Tooltip tip="Administration User Interface">AUI</Tooltip> for each gateway.
        <img alt="RACK Gateways" src="/images/gateways.png"></img>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Configure Outbound Route
We will use the gateway named **Rack1** as our Outbound Route.  The first pre-configured instance of Mirth, **Mirth1** has a channel created to load any files placed in a certain directory and send them to the IP address of **Rack1** at port 3333.
In this step, we will create an Outbound Route on **Rack1** that listens on port 3333 and signs, encrypts and sends data to **Rack2**.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create RACK Identifier">
        Select the "Identifiers" item from the left menu:
        <img alt="RACK Identifiers" src="/images/rack-identifiers.png"></img>
        Click on "Add Identifier" and in the dialog, give the identifier an **Alias** of "Rack1" and set the **Number of Signing Keys**, **Number of Rotation Keys**, **Signing Threshold** and **Rotation Threshold** all to `1`:
        <img alt="Create RACK Identifier" src="/images/rack-create-identifier.png"></img>
        Click **Save** to create an Identifier that is local to this <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Outbound Routes">
        Now we will define the Outbound Route to the **Rack2** gateway.  This is done from the **Outbound Routes** menu item on the left:

        <img alt="Outbound Routes" src="/images/outbound-routes.png"></img>
        Click on the **Add Outbound Route** button to create the route.

        Give the Outbound Route an **Name** of "To Rack2** (to indicate the data's destination), leave the **Peer-to-Peer** radio button selected, select the "Rack1" Identifier you just created from the **Local Identifier to Secure the Connection**, leave the **Protocol** set to "HTTP" and set the **Local Port* to 3333.

        <img alt="Create Outbound Route" src="/images/create-outbound-route.png"></img>
        Click **Save** to create the Outbound Route to **Rack2**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Export Introduction">
        The two <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways will be connected to each other using the same <Tooltip tip="Composable Event Streaming Representation">CESR</Tooltip> file approach we used to connect Locksmith to each gateway.
        To establish this connection you will not export an introduction to the Identifier you created for this <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateway from the Outbound Route grid.
        <Note>We export introductions from the route grids so they also contain gateway connection information that allows them to be discovered by other gateways </Note>
        <img alt="Export Introduction" src="/images/outbound-export-introduction.png"></img>
        Open the Actions menu for the Outbound Route you just created and select the Export Introduction menu item.  A new file will be saved on your computer named "Rack1-To Rack2.cesr".  We will use this file in the next step.
    </Step>
</Steps>
