## Coming Soon
Anchored data represents a true innovation in cybersecurity.  The <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> protocol is the only Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) protocol available that allows you apply digital signatures to data that can survive
identifier key rotations while simultaneously protecting your data from a dead key attack.  healthKERI's <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways provide advanced configuration options for anchoring every signature on every bit of data
in the key state of signing identifiers ensuring the longevity of each signature as well as ensuring that only the data you meant to sign is ever trusted.

When anchored data is combined with healthKERI's hosted Witness Operational Network and Watcher Operational Network, you can be sure that all data is exchanged in Zero-Trust.  And in the event of any key compromise (including a post quantum event), you will be immediately notified and able to recover.

In this installment of our tutorial series, we will walk you through the configuration for anchored data and help you set up <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> [Witnesses](/essentials/overview#witness) and [Watchers](/essentials/overview#watcher) to lock down all your data exchange flows.
