### [KERIpy](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy)
KERIpy is the most mature and widely used KERI implementation, written in Python. It serves as a reference for many
other implementations in the ecosystem.

**Key Features:**
- Support for the core KERI protocol specification
- Comprehensive test suite and regular updates from the KERI community
- Example scripts and tooling to help you bootstrap a KERI environment

**Use Cases:**
- Ideal for anyone wanting a stable, well-documented Python library from which to learn KERI and implement their own
applications.

### [KERIA](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria)
KERIA (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure Agent) provides cloud-based agents built on top of the KERI protocol for the
purpose of managing KERI identifiers in a hosted environment.

**Key Features:**
- Preconfigured endpoints for managing KERI events in the cloud
- Integration with KERIpy for event processing

**Use Cases:**
- Organizations or individuals looking to host their own KERI agent or agent based service

### [Signify-TS](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts)
Signify-TS is a KERI implementation in TypeScript, targeting Node.js and browser-based applications. It is an excellent
choice if your stack is JavaScript/TypeScript-heavy.

**Key Features:**
- Written for modern JavaScript/TypeScript environments; integrate in full-stack or front-end apps.
- Active development to remain aligned with the evolving KERI standard.
- Can be used alongside popular frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) for decentralized identity features.

**Use Cases:**
- Building user-facing web applications that interact with KERI-based identifiers directly in the browser.
- Developers preferring TypeScriptâ€™s type-safety and ecosystem.
