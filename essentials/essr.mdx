## [Encryption](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/encryption-and-signing/)
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext such that only someone with the appropriate key can
reverse it. In a KERI ecosystem, each entity is represented by an Autonomic Identifier (AID) tied to unique key pairs.
An identifier's current public key(s) are anchored in the Key Event Log (KEL), which is published by a witness.
By way of a watcher, the sender can retrieve the recipient's KEL from their witness and derive a public key for
encryption. Once the sender's message is encrypted via this public key, the sender sends the message to the recipient.
only the intended recipient who controls the corresponding private key can decrypt and read the data, ensuring
end-to-end confidentiality.

## [Signing](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/encryption-and-signing/)
Signing is the process of generating a cryptographic signature over data, allowing verifiers to confirm the data's
origin and integrity. In the context of KERI, this guarantees that the data truly originates from the party controlling
the private key associated with a given AID. To sign data, a sender uses one of their AID's private signing keys; any recipient
can then verify the signature by fetching the matching public key the from the sender's KEL via the recipient's watcher
and sender's witness. This approach eliminates the need for centralized authorities to vouch for public keys, since the
KEL’s integrity ensures that the correct key belongs to the sender.

## Bringing It All Together: [ESSR](https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079) in [KERI](./overview)
ESSR (Encrypt Sender’s key and then Sign Receiver’s key) is a pattern in which the sender first encrypts data or a
message for the receiver, then attaches a signature. In combination with KERI infrastructure, this pattern ensures that
the intended recipient is the only one able to decrypt the data, while also proving that the sender truly originated
the message.

This approach provides end-to-end confidentiality by encrypting with the receiver’s public key derived from their KEL
and ensures non-repudiation via the sender’s verifiable signature (which is likewise anchored in their own KEL).
Because KERI watchers and witnesses confirm that no duplicitous key states exist, both parties can trust they are always
using each other’s current valid keys. If either party rotates their key pair, witnesses and watchers make these changes
to the KEL publicly discoverable and verifiable, eliminating the need for reissuing certificates or relying on any
central authority.
