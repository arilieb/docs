## Coming Soon
healthKERI's <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways are not just for API endpoint security.  When combined with the Locksmith <Tooltip tip="Key Event Receipt Infrastructure">KERI</Tooltip> wallet and secure proxy, RACK gateways can
be used to allow secure and confidential authenticated access to any web portal, web application or SFTP/SSH server.

In this final installment of our tutorial series, we will walk you though the steps needed to begin a transition to the ultimate expression of True Zero-Trust network access by authenticating every bit of data over every single transaction at every resource in your network.
