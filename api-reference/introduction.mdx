<Note>
  Both healthKERI.net and the <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> Gateways will expose APIs accessible for advanced management and configuration.  Documentation for these APIs is coming soon...
</Note>

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

Every interaction with all API endpoints will be authenticated using signed and encrypted transactions using the same
Encrypt Sender / Sign Receiver (ESSR) technology that power our <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> Gateways.  More information will be available soon.
