## Welcome

Please check back in a few weeks for our RACK Gateway and healthKERI.net API documentation here.

## Authentication

Every interaction with all API endpoints will be authenticated using signed and encrypted transactions using the same
Encrypt Sender / Sign Receiver (ESSR) technology that power our <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> Gateways.  More information will be available soon.
