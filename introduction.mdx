“Signing everything” means using cryptographically secure digital signatures on every transaction. In this zero-trust environment, data is only sent/ingested when valid digital signatures are used. No more shared secrets.

We achieve this by combining the most advanced key management protocol available, [Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/), with an approach to confidential and authentic data exchange called [ESSR](./essentials/essr), for "Encrypt Sender's key and then Sign Receiver's key", which is detailed [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079). For a more accessible explanation see the following: [PKAE1](https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-i/), [PKAE2](https://neilmadden.blog/2018/11/26/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-ii/), [PKAE3](https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/).

This unique combination of protocols allows our gateways to establish [True Zero-Trust](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/modern-approaches-network-access-security) connections that rely on post quantum secure identifiers, while keeping your "keys at the edge", where they belong.



## Setting up

The first step to securing all your data is learning how our **Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI (RACK)** Gateways work.
