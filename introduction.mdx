“Signing everything” means using cryptographically secure digital signatures on every transaction. In this zero-trust environment, data is only sent/ingested when valid digital signatures are used. No more shared secrets.
## Setting up

The first step to securing all your data is learning how our Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI (RACK) Gateways work.
