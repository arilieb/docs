## Coming Soon
This section of our tutorial series will be dedicated to Cloud Routers.  These are instances of <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways
that run as provisioned services on healthKERI's infrastructure on your behalf.  All data that flows through our routers is opaque to us, but with Cloud Routers, we can monitor your data flows
for abnormalities and alert you immediately.  In addition, we use our hosted Watcher Operational Network to monitor all your identifiers' key state for any signs of duplicity.

Unlike a [Peer-to-Peer configuration](/quickstart), <Tooltip tip="Routing, Authentication and Confidentiality with KERI">RACK</Tooltip> gateways connected through healthKERI Cloud Routers do not have to listen for incoming connections on the open Internet.
